# LIBREOFFICE CERTIFICATION PRE-REQUISITES

LibreOffice Certification is open to all qualified professionals, with an obvious preference for TDF Members and active project members.

For the time being, LibreOffice Certification is free for everyone. On the other hand, The Document Foundation may decide at any time to ask for coverage of expenses incurred by the organization for the maintenance of the certification project.

LibreOffice Certification will always be free \(as in beer\) for TDF Members, and also for active project members such as regular code contributors, volunteers active in QA and localization projects, contributors of native language projects, and other volunteers recognized for the quality and continuity of their work by the Certification Committee.

Certification is subject to the involvement in LibreOffice development, or in migration and training projects. The involvement must be demonstrated by a number of relevant documents \(described in a list at the end of this document\), or testified by a TDF Member who has been certified - in the same discipline - for at least one year.

Applications of people who have never been involved in the LibreOffice project, neither in development nor in migrations and/or trainings, will be managed as an exception to the standard process on a case by case basis. These individuals will have to go through a specific certification training \(in English\), based on distance learning technologies, to get the title of “Trained xxx Professional” \(where xxx is either Migration or Training\). They will be followed by a mentor for one year, and at the end they will be able to access the certification process.

Professionals willing to be certified must fill in the application form, and provide the necessary documents \(see the list below\). Once the Certification Committee has duly reviewed and approved the application, the candidate will be able to go through the peer-to-peer review.

Certification is open throughout the year. Once candidates are approved by the Certification Committee, they will be admitted to the peer-to-peer review session. There will be at least two sessions each year: one at FOSDEM in Winter and one at the LibreOffice Conference in Summer. Other certification sessions might be planned according to the number of candidates.

### **Certification expiration and renewal**

Certification will expire two years after the peer-to-peer review, and could be renewed for another two years after the expiration date, based on the following criteria:

1. Professionals whose activity is known to at least one member of the Certification Committee will be renewed automatically, and will be informed by email;

2. Professionals whose activity is not known by Certification Committee members but is known at community level will be renewed when the local community will have confirmed their activity, and will be informed by email

3. Professionals whose activity is not known at any level, neither by Certification Committee members nor by the local community, will be asked about their continued interest in LibreOffice certification and will have to go through the peer-to-peer review.

### **Relationship with The Document Foundation**

Certified professionals are bound by the Certification Code of Conduct. In case of any doubt about the interpretation of this document, please ask via email at [certification@libreoffice.org](mailto:certification@libreoffice.org).

Any behaviour contrary to the Certification Code of Conduct, following a motion from the Certification Committee, the Board of Directors, or the Engineering Steering Committee, will result either in the invitation to a new peer-to-peer review to re-confirm the status, or in the exclusion from the status of certified professional.

Certified professionals will be listed on The Document Foundation website. They will also receive a certificate \(with the date of expiration\) which they will be able to use - according to the Code of Conduct - to show their status.

### **Documents suitable for the application**

The following list cannot be considered in any way as complete or exhaustive:

1. Project plan for the migration to LibreOffice.

2. Project plan for LibreOffice trainings, including syllabus.

3. Syllabus for LibreOffice trainings, including subject of lessons.

5. Slides to support training courses, with examples and exercises.
